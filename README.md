## Statistical Techniques Used

| Variable                     | Test Used          | Hypothesis                                                | Result                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Age vs Attrition            | T-Test             | Age affects employee attrition                            | Significant            |
| Distance from Home vs Attrition | T-Test         | Distance affects employee attrition                       | Significant            |
| Work-Life Balance vs Attrition | Chi-Square Test | Work-life balance is associated with attrition            | Significant            |
| Relationship Satisfaction vs Attrition | Chi-Square Test | Relationship satisfaction influences attrition |  Not Significant        |
| Tenure vs Attrition         | Trend Analysis     | Longer tenure reduces likelihood of attrition             | Observed Pattern       |

## Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**:
  - Attrition vs Work-Life Balance
  - Attrition vs Relationship Satisfaction
- **Pie Chart**:
  - Attrition distribution across Age Groups and Tenure Groups
- **Histograms**:
  - Distance from Home grouped by Attrition
- **Line Chart**:
  - Age vs Attrition Count

## Key Insights

- Younger employees are more likely to leave.
- Employees living farther from the office show higher attrition.
- Work-life balance is significantly associated with attrition.
- Relationship satisfaction does **not** strongly influence attrition.
- Longer tenure suggests more employee loyalty and lower attrition.
